Welcome to Number Guesser Game!

The rules of the game are simple: Players have to simultaneously guess a number. Whoever guesses the number correctly first
wins the game.

To start a new game, fill out the form at the bottom of the landing page with the name of the game, the maximum number and the
password 'password' (pshhh, don't tell this to any malicious person). The number that has to be guessed lies between 0 and the 
number specified as maximum number. It will be a new random number for every new game (unless the game was rigged :O). To enter
a game, simply click on the name of the game in the list and state who you are. 

Now that the rules are clear: Let the games begin and may the fastest player win - or the best fortune teller.
